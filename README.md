## User Stories
* As someone who is an avid reader, I want all of my books in one place so that I can reference what I have lined up to read.
* As someone who doesn’t read very much, I want to look at the reviews others have posted so that I can be inspired.
* As someone looking for their next book, I want to peruse a digital library for stuff I’m interested in.
